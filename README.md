Implementation of [RAFT: Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms for Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12039.pdf) using PyTorch's TorchVision package.

I used the model from TorchVision for this repo.\
So, the results could be different from other implementations.\

Feel free to use this repo for your optical flow experiments!
